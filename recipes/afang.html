    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Afang soup is a tasty, nutritious Nigerian soup, native to the Efiks/Ibibios (Akwa Ibom & Cross river states).</p>
    <p>Afang soup is one of the richest and somewhat medicinal vegetable soups of the Efiks/Ibibios in Nigeria. The Igbos’ have a similar soup known as Okazi soup.The only major difference is that a soup thickener is added to Okazi Soup to increase its viscosity(thickness), but afang soup gets its thickness from the bulk of vegetables used in preparing it.</p>
