    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Egusi Soup is another great and famous soup amongst most cultures in Nigeria. It is made of grounded melon seeds; which can be cooked with different vegetables such as Spinach, Bitter leaf, Ugwu and others.</p>
    <p>This soup is cooked in different ways by the different cultures in Nigeria. This post is about a quicker way of making this soup; the Yoruba Style. I learnt this recipe after seeing my mum make this soup so many times. In my family, we call it ‘Mummy’s quick visitors’ soup’ because whenever we have visitors in the house, we would normally just see mum rush into the kitchen, and no more than 30 minutes later, she’s out of the kitchen with an amazing dish full of Egusi soup looking superbly delicious.
    Egusi Soup can also be served with foods like Pounded Yam, Eba, Amala, Fufu, Wheat, Semolina, and even Rice.
    I do hope you guys find this quick recipe helpful.</p>
